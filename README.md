# 1.20.4 Minecraft Spigot plugin

### This plugin is a joke. Don't take it seriously.


## What is this plugin?
This plugin adds tobacco and cigarettes to the game. You can use it to puff smokes or smug it into your friend's country.


## How to use it
This plugin adds 4 different items to the game:

- **Tobacco**: This item is the main ingredient for crafting cigarettes. You can get it by putting `BROWN_MUSHROOM` in a stonecutter.

- **Cigarette**: This is the main item of the plugin. You can craft it in the following pattern: <br>
PAPER | TOBACCO | PAPER <br>
PAPER | TOBACCO | PAPER <br>
PAPER | OAK_LEAVES | PAPER

- **Farm Sheep**: This is a sheep that you can use to farm tobacco. You can shear it either by hand or with a dispenser.

- **Stub**: This is the result of smoking a cigarette. It makes a pretty good dye :)
